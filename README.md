fprintf: The Formatted Storyteller for C
Ever wanted your C programs to sing, not just print? Well, fret no more! fprintf is here to be your coding bard!

What is fprintf?

Imagine a jester in a grand hall, weaving tales with words and wit. fprintf is like that jester, but for your C programs. It takes control of the output stream (think of it as the stage) and uses a format string (the script) to tell a story with your data (the props!).

How does it work?

fprintf follows a simple recipe:

The Stage: You provide a file stream (like stdout for the console) where the story unfolds.
The Script: A format string tells fprintf how to present your data. It uses placeholders like %d for integers, %f for floats, and %s for strings, much like magic markers highlighting your performance.
The Props: After the format string, you list the data you want to display, like the numbers and messages that bring your story to life.
Why use fprintf?

Flexibility: Craft informative messages, debug output, or even create formatted reports, all with a single function.
Control: Decide exactly how your data is presented, from decimal places to alignment.
Power: Combine multiple data types and text in a single formatted string.
